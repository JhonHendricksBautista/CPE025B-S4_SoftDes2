            <h2>What Is RAM and Why Is It Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Random Access Memory (RAM) is the short-term memory of a computer. 
                It temporarily stores data that the processor needs to access quickly 
                in order to run applications and perform tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without enough RAM, your computer can become slow and unresponsive. 
                RAM plays a critical role in multitasking, gaming, content creation, 
                and overall system performance.

            <h2>What is RAM?</h2>
            <p>
                RAM is volatile memory that holds active programs and data. 
                Once the computer is turned off, the contents of RAM are erased.

            <h2>Why RAM Matters</h2>
            <p>
                More RAM allows your computer to run multiple applications smoothly 
                and improves overall system responsiveness.

            <h2>Types of RAM</h2>
            <p>
                Common types include DDR3, DDR4, and DDR5. 
                Newer generations provide faster speeds and better power efficiency.

        <h2>Why Are RAM Prices Rising?</h2>

        <p>
            RAM prices fluctuate based on global supply and demand. In recent years, 
            several factors have contributed to the increase in memory costs.
        </p>

        <p>
            One major reason is the growing demand for high-performance hardware. 
            Gaming PCs, data centers, artificial intelligence systems, and smartphones 
            all require large amounts of memory.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another factor is limited production capacity. Manufacturing advanced 
            memory chips is expensive and complex. Any disruption in supply chains 
            or fabrication plants can reduce output and drive prices higher.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, newer technologies such as DDR5 are more costly to produce 
            than previous generations. As manufacturers shift toward these newer standards, 
            older and cheaper memory types become less available.
